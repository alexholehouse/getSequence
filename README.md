getSequence
==============================

A tool to get a uniprot sequence returned to terminal or from within Python.

# What is getSequence?

getSequence is a command-line interface for printing protein sequences from Uniprot to your terminal. I made this because I was tired of having to navigate to the website, copy a sequence, and format it. It also has functionality to use in Python.

# How does it work?

getSequence will take in your name and query Uniprot. It then takes the top hit from Uniprot and gets the sequence information. You can specify multiple things from the command-line or form Python, exactly how you would if you were to use the search box on the Uniprot website.

# This seems kind of unnecessary...

Fair enough. I still think it's nifty.
